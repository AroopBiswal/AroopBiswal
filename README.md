## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Aroop, I graduated in June 2024 from UC Davis with a BS in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm very passionate about AI/Machine Learning and I have experience working with this domain in both large companies and fast-paced startups. I am currently a SWE working  at [Meaku AI](https://meaku.ai/) where I'm building an AI-first customer service agent.  We've recently launched our product to several clients, and it's been exciting to see it start making a real impact in the field ðŸ¤—.
